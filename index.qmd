## Bio

I am an R developer and Data Scientist with a bakground in bioinformatics and
public financial audit.

My current role is as an R/R Shiny developer at Audit Scotland. In this role I
am part of a small team that develop web-based applications (primarily R Shiny)
for the analysis of financial and performance audit data generated from public
bodies in Scotland. The overarching theme of this work is to use data analytics
to gain insighta into the performance of public bodies across Scotland. This
contributes to Audit Scotland's overall aim to ensure public money is well spent
to meet the needs of the people of Scotland.

My previous roles include a Senior Bioinformatics Developer and Bioinformatician
at Fios Genomics. Fios Genomics is a contract research organisation providing
bioinformatic data analytsis support to a range of clients in the pharmaceutical
and academic sectors. At my time at Fios Genomics I was part of a small team
that developed R and Python software packages. These packages were used by a
team of bioinformaticians to perform bioinformatic analyses. This include
differential gene expression analyses, anti-sense oligonucleotide design, and
genetic variant calling and analysis.

I have keen interest in R package development and how tools such as Shiny and
Quarto can be used to visualise complex datasets.

This site contains a copy of my CV and a list of some projects that I have
worked on.
