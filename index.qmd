## Bio

I am an R developer and Bioinformatician currently working as an R/R Shiny
developer at Audit Scotland. In this role I am part of a small team that develop
web-based applications (primarily R Shiny) for the analysis of financial and
performance audit data generated from public bodies in Scotland. The overarching
theme of this work is to use a data-first analytics approach to gain insight
into the performance of public bodies across Scotland. This contributes to Audit
Scotland's overall aim to ensure public money is well spent to meet the needs of
the people of Scotland.

My previous role was as Senior Bioinformatics Developer at Fios Genomics. In
this role, I was part of a team that developed R and Python software packages.
These packages were used by a team of bioinformaticians to perform bioinformatic
analyses for a range of clients in the pharmaceutical and academic sectors.

I have keen interest in R package development and how tools such as Shiny and
Quarto can be used to visualise complex datasets.

On this site I keep a copy of my CV and a list of some projects I have worked
on.
