**Motivation**

During 2024 and 2025 I was moving between various addresses in Glasgow and
Edinburgh and, as many readers may be aware of, the process of changing GP
practice can be headache inducing. Nevermind having to do this several times in
1 year! I found the process of trying to find out what GP practices were in my
local area and how to contact them overly complicated. This is when the idea of
`HealthDataScotland` was born.

The first thought was just to create an interactive dashboard that would allow
users to view GP practices in their local area and obtain their contact details.
However, I thought why stop here?! Why only present GP practices and only
present their contact details? Why not try make an application that was generic
enough that it could present locations of any health care centre in your local
area? And why not present some statistics about those health care centres that
joe-public might be interested in? Therefore, I underwent a process of trying to
identify what public data sets were available and then trying to use an
object-oriented approach to design an R package that was able to handle
different health care centres and present their data in an appropriate manner.

**Output**

`HealthDataScotland` is an R package containing functionality to extract,
transform and load (ETL) GP practice and hospital data from across Scotland, and
present this as an interactive R shiny application.

The shiny application itself is hosted using the Azure container app service
using a custom domain name. The data underlying the application is stored using
the Azure blob service and the ETL process is performed periodically using a
GitHub CI script.

For more details please refer to the
[documentation](https://jsleight1.github.io/HealthDataScotland/).

**Future work**

As previously mentioned, I have tried to design the underlying R package to be
generic enough to handle different health care centres and present them
appropriately in the app. Currently `HealthDataScotland` only presents GP
practices and hospitals. However one could imagine future versions of the app
presenting the location of other health care settings such as dental practices
or pharmacies.
