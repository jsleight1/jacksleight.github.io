## [HealthDataScotland](https://www.healthdatascotland.co.uk/)

![](img/healthdatascotland_screenshot.jpg)

**Motivation**

During 2024 and 2025 I was moving between various addresses. I found the process
of trying to find out what GP practices were in my local area and how to contact
them overly complicated. This is when the idea of `HealthDataScotland` was born.
My first thought was just to create an interactive dashboard that would allow
users to view GP practices in their local area and obtain their contact details.
However, I thought why stop here?! Why only present GP practices and only
present their contact details? Why not try make an application that was generic
enough that it could present locations of any health care centre in your local
area? And why not present some interesting statistics about those health care
centres? Therefore, I underwent a process of trying to identify what public data
sets were available and then trying to use an object-oriented approach to design
an R package that was able to handle different health care centres and present
their data in an appropriate manner.

**Output**

`HealthDataScotland` is an R package containing functionality to extract,
transform and load (ETL) GP practice and hospital data from across Scotland, and
present this as an interactive R shiny application.

The shiny application itself is hosted using the Azure container app service
with a custom domain name. The data underlying the application is stored using
the Azure blob service and the ETL process is performed periodically using a
GitHub CI script.

For more details please refer to the
[documentation](https://jsleight1.github.io/HealthDataScotland/).

**Please note the container is not always running and may take a few moments to
load**

**Future work**

As previously mentioned, I have tried to design the underlying R package to be
generic enough to handle different health care centres and present them
appropriately in the app. Currently `HealthDataScotland` only presents GP
practices and hospitals. However one could imagine future versions of the app
presenting the location of other health care settings such as dental practices
or pharmacies.


## [COVID-19 Scotland](https://jack-sleight.shinyapps.io/covid_shiny/)

**Motivation**

In 2020 the UK had been placed into lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Like most people I suddenly had some free time of my hands and wanted
to try and do something productive. I was relatively new to coding in R and had
never made an R shiny application before. I knew that the Scottish COVID-19
statistics were released publicly on a daily basis and I thought it would be a
good idea to try and make an R Shiny application that used these data sets.

**Output**

`covid19_scotland` is an R shiny application containing functionality to perform
an ETL process of COVID-19 pandemic statistics from across Scotland, and present
this as an interactive R shiny application.

The shiny application is hosted on `shinyapps.io` with the data being stored
using Dropbox. During the pandemic the ETL process was performed periodically
using a local CRON job.

This application was my first ever public data application and provided me with
a good understanding as to how publicly available data can be visualised using
tools such as R Shiny.

**Future work**

This application was deprecated in 2022.
