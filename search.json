    "text": "Motivation\nDuring 2024 and 2025 I was moving between various addresses in Glasgow and Edinburgh and, as many readers may be aware of, the process of changing GP practice can be headache inducing. Nevermind having to do this several times in 1 year! I found the process of trying to find out what GP practices were in my local area and how to contact them overly complicated. This is when the idea of HealthDataScotland was born.\nThe first thought was just to create an interactive dashboard that would allow users to view GP practices in their local area and obtain their contact details. However, I thought why stop here?! Why only present GP practices and only present their contact details? Why not try make an application that was generic enough that it could present locations of any health care centre in your local area? And why not present some statistics about those health care centres that joe-public might be interested in? Therefore, I underwent a process of trying to identify what public data sets were available and then trying to use an object-oriented approach to design an R package that was able to handle different health care centres and present their data in an appropriate manner.\nOutput\nHealthDataScotland is an R package containing functionality to extract, transform and load (ETL) GP practice and hospital data from across Scotland, and present this as an interactive R shiny application.\nThe shiny application itself is hosted using the Azure container app service using a custom domain name. The data underlying the application is stored using the Azure blob service and the ETL process is performed periodically using a GitHub CI script.\nFor more details please refer to the documentation.\nFuture work\nAs previously mentioned, I have tried to design the underlying R package to be generic enough to handle different health care centres and present them appropriately in the app. Currently HealthDataScotland only presents GP practices and hospitals. However one could imagine future versions of the app presenting the location of other health care settings such as dental practices or pharmacies."
